## Getting Started
Install node dependencies:

    npm install

Start the development server:

    npm start

Navigate to:

    http://localhost:8001/

This will watch all files, rebuild and hot-load the running dev server code with your changes. No need to refresh the browser.

## Tests
Testing is done with the [Karma]() test runner and the [Jasmine]() framework. Tests in this example are written with es6 syntax.

To run tests:

    npm run test

This will watch all files involved in the defined tests and automatically rebuild/test on save.
